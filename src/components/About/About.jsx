              Hey there! I'm Nirvan Jha, a web developer with a passion for
              coding and a background in mechanical engineering. Currently, I'm
              studying at IIITDM Kancheepuram, immersing myself in the world of
              gears and equations while also exploring the digital realm of web
              development. I've always been fascinated by how things work, which
              naturally led me to pursue mechanical engineering. But alongside
              my studies, I found myself drawn to the endless possibilities of
              coding. It wasn't long before I was diving into HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript, eager to create something unique and impactful. My
              journey in web development is still in its early stages, but my
              first project is already underway. It's been an exciting
              experience, filled with challenges and learning opportunities.
              Despite the demands of my mechanical engineering curriculum, I'm
              committed to honing my skills as a web developer and pushing the
              boundaries of what I can create. I'm eager to connect with
              like-minded individuals who share my passion for coding and
              innovation. Whether it's collaborating on projects, exchanging
              ideas, or simply sharing experiences, I believe that surrounding
              myself with a supportive community is essential for growth. So if
              you're passionate about technology and love to code, don't
              hesitate to reach out. I'd love to connect and explore the
              possibilities together. After all, the journey is always more
              fulfilling when you have companions along the way. Let's create
              something amazing!
